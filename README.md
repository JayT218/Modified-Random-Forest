# Modified-Random-Forest

This project proposed two approaches that by modifying traditional random forest, they can increase accuracy by 10% compared with traditional random forest.

Approach 1 replaced the least accuracy tree in the forest in each iteration, and approach 2 replaced the trees that have lower accuracy than the mean accuracy in each iteration.

The random forest library is from scikit-learn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
The datasets are from UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
